       <img src="img/IMG_13821.jpg" alt="Erin's Crew" style="float:right;width:50%;height:50%;">
       <p>This project aims to create two deliverables to our favorite chef in the making: a Mise en Place and a costing conversion calculation.</p>
       <br>
       <br>
       <h3>Mise En Place</h3>
       <p>The purpose of this document is to group items from multiple recipes together to help the chef prepare for cooking multiple recipes at once. So for example, a chef takes on the task of creating four recipes at once. This chef must collect and organize all ingredients in one location to begin the process. Finding all ingredients in a specific category will be much easier if all ingredients are merged together and sorted based on location in the kitchen. The aim will be able to identify how much of an ingredient is required in total. Thus reducing the math required for the chef to gather all ingredients at once. A Mise en Place also gives the chef overall instrunction for making all recipes at once through directioins. The chef can do this part on their own! (For now). </p>
       <br>
       <h3>Costing Conversion</h3>
       <p>This idea is perhaps the main focus of this project. With current costing infromation, this project aims to calculate the cost of a recipe per serving. Using costing deatails provided by the current bulk sale used in Collin County Community College culinary program, a recipe's cost can be calculated taking into account cooking phenomena such as 'yield.' When you start salsal verde with a pound of tomatillos and afterwards are left with a small portion of salsa, you discover the phenomena of yield. This project aims to identify common conversions between recipe ingredients and costing information to provide a current cost of a recipe planned.</p>
