        <p>This site is dedicated to an aspring chef currently working her way through culinary school.</p>
        <p>This project hopes to help Erin in her future as a chef and with any luck during her tenure at school. The goal of this project is to create what is call a 'Mise en Place' and to help with costing conversions for recipes. The project will eventually support the documentation necessary to prepare several recipes at a time.</p>
       <p>Because costing is very important here, there are a few rules to using this website. First and foremost, an ingredient must be entered before creating any recipes. There is an option to entire the costing information, but if you don't know it now, that's okay we can work with just the ingredients. Second, an ingredient cannot be deleted if there is a recipe currently using that ingredient. Third, feel free to share the best family recipes you have.</p>
       <h3>Bon Appetit!</h3>
